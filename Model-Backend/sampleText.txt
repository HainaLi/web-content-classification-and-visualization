9 We have some news. Its not good. Hillary Clintons communications director Jennifer Palmieri filled the candidate in as the plane landed in Iowa, with campaign manager Robby Mook in the huddle. Jim Comeys letter had hit when they were still in the air, without wifi, and now they were all at once processing the news and a game plan and the worry the FBI director had delivered an existential hit to a campaign already more nervous than it had been letting on. Story Continued Below Clinton was sitting up in her private cabin, chatting with childhood friend Betsy Ebeling. You knew we werent done, Palmieri told the boss. I knew there would be something, Clinton told them with a slight smile.

15 Why the Chinese are laughing at the U.S.
16 In June 1989, Chinese students and laborers by the thousands occupied Beijings Tiananmen Square, the central square in the capital city of the most populous nation in the world. A giant portrait of Mao Zedong glowered at them from across the street. There was an ineffable sense back then that history was in the air everywhere-that powerful forces were moving across the world, and that they were moving in the right direction. Mikhail Gorbachev had by then come to power in the Soviet Union, and in the summer of 1989 he would allow Moscows client states in Eastern Europe to go their own way politically toward democracy. Thats what the students in Tiananmen wanted too. Gorbachev had visited Beijing

19 Before packing your bags to retire abroad
20 Does retiring on the cheap to a quaint rural town in Canada, tropical paradise or a bustling European or Asian city sound enticing to you? It seems that every year, intriguing articles and books recount how cash-strapped Americans make their savings last longer while living a glorious retired life in a low-cost locale overseas. But how many Americans are actually retiring abroad? According to International Living magazine, the Social Security Administration reported that more than 600,000 Social Security checks were sent abroad in 2014, more than double the number in 2002. And that might understate how many people retire and live outside the U.S. because many retirees might continue banking domestically

26 Eye for an eye? Iranian thug blinded for throwing acid in 4-year-old girls face
27 Iran has blinded a man on Tuesday after convicting him of throwing chemicals in face of a four-year-old girl, a judicial official was quoted as saying. The little child was left completely unable to see by the brutal attack - leading the state to sentence the attacker to the literal eye-for-an-eye punishment. The head of criminal affairs at the Tehran prosecutors office, Mohammad Shahriari, said it was the second time this year that Iran has carried out the punishment, which can be imposed for such crimes in the Islamic republic. In 2009, this man threw lime into the face of a little girl of four years in the Sanandaj region, leaving her blind, the ISNA news agency quoted him as saying.
